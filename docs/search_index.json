Our team presents interactive visualizations and interesting insights into the Airbnb data. We like choosing Airbnb for accommodations when traveling because of their low cost, convenient location, and household amenities. We focus on New York Citys data because we live in New York and we love this amazing city, we wish to perform an in-depth analysis on one of the most popular popular tourist destinations in the world. Following are a few questions that we aim to answer through our analysis: 1. How is the price and rating of Airbnb in NYC? 2. How do prices vary by neighbourhoods? 3. What is the time series pattern for prices? 4. What makes a host Super host? 5. How do rating scores vary by neighbourhoods? 6. Is there any relations existing among variables? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data Sources", " Chapter 2 Data Sources The data we use for this project is the newest listings Airbnb data for New York City, which is obtained directly from the Inside Airbnb website : http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/ny/new-york-city/2020-10-05/data/listings.csv.gz. New York City has always been one of the hottest markets for Airbnb. We believe targeting NYC dataset would provide us rich information to understand the rental landscape in NYC. Note that in this project we only use the listings data. Although Reviews data and Calendar data for upcoming year is also available on the website, we would like to focus on the unbiased numerical data that has been validated. The listings dataset is consists of 74 attributes for 44,666 listing in New York City. As we aim to gain a holistic analysis of the Aribnb market in New York City, we discard many uninformative or miscellaneous attributes such as id, host names, urls, review times, and descriptions etc. We deliberately select 18 attributes that covers the The attributes we selected for our analysis are the following: Listing id : contiunous variable, the id of the listing Host id : contiunous variable, the id of the host of the listing Host_is_superhost : categorical variable, whether or not the host for this listing is superhost (Experienced hosts who provide a shining example for other hosts, and extraordinary experiences for their guests) Neighbourhood_cleansed : categorical variable, the neighborhood of the listing (Midtown, Hells Kitchen, Upper West Side ) Neighborhood_group_cleansed : categorical variable, the neighborhood group of the listing (Manhatten, Brooklyn, Bronx ) Latitude : contiunous variable, the latitude of the listing Longitude : contiunous variable, the longtitude of the listing Room_type : categorical variable, the room type of the listing (Entire home, Private room ) Bedrooms : categorical variable, the number of bedrooms in the listing Price : contiunous variable, the price per night for the listing Reviews per month : contiunous variable, the average number of reviews the listing received per month Review_scores_rating : contiunous variable, the overall rating of the listing Review_scores_location : contiunous variable, the rating for the locating of the listing Availability_365 : contiunous variable, the number of available days of the listing per year We notice several issues related to the dataset: Missing values : There are NAs in 4 columns (bedrooms, reviews_per_month, reviews_scores_rating, review_scores_location) Non-Availability : Almost half of the listings has 0 available days for booking in the year. Note that the host has the choice to set their listing as not available. The datailed treatment of those issues will be discussed in the following chapters. library(dplyr) listings &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;data/listings.csv&quot;) %&gt;% select(id,host_id, host_is_superhost, neighbourhood_cleansed, neighbourhood_group_cleansed, latitude, longitude, room_type, bedrooms, price, reviews_per_month, review_scores_rating, review_scores_location, availability_365) summary(listings) ## id host_id host_is_superhost ## Min. : 2595 Min. : 2438 : 17 ## 1st Qu.:10555068 1st Qu.: 9354841 f:36633 ## Median :22266056 Median : 37854928 t: 8016 ## Mean :23227109 Mean : 85318403 ## 3rd Qu.:36239498 3rd Qu.:137358866 ## Max. :45730924 Max. :370512147 ## ## neighbourhood_cleansed neighbourhood_group_cleansed latitude ## Williamsburg : 3302 Bronx : 1158 Min. :40.51 ## Bedford-Stuyvesant: 3291 Brooklyn :17851 1st Qu.:40.69 ## Harlem : 2451 Manhattan :19741 Median :40.72 ## Bushwick : 2124 Queens : 5602 Mean :40.73 ## Hell&#39;s Kitchen : 1782 Staten Island: 314 3rd Qu.:40.76 ## Upper West Side : 1781 Max. :40.91 ## (Other) :29935 ## longitude room_type bedrooms price ## Min. :-74.24 Entire home/apt:22860 Min. : 1.000 $100.00: 1633 ## 1st Qu.:-73.98 Hotel room : 388 1st Qu.: 1.000 $150.00: 1627 ## Median :-73.96 Private room :20498 Median : 1.000 $50.00 : 1364 ## Mean :-73.95 Shared room : 920 Mean : 1.292 $60.00 : 1145 ## 3rd Qu.:-73.93 3rd Qu.: 1.000 $75.00 : 1140 ## Max. :-73.71 Max. :21.000 $80.00 : 1058 ## NA&#39;s :4259 (Other):36699 ## reviews_per_month review_scores_rating review_scores_location availability_365 ## Min. : 0.010 Min. : 20.00 Min. : 2.000 Min. : 0.0 ## 1st Qu.: 0.110 1st Qu.: 92.00 1st Qu.: 9.000 1st Qu.: 0.0 ## Median : 0.350 Median : 97.00 Median :10.000 Median : 1.0 ## Mean : 0.864 Mean : 93.85 Mean : 9.594 Mean :105.4 ## 3rd Qu.: 1.130 3rd Qu.:100.00 3rd Qu.:10.000 3rd Qu.:189.0 ## Max. :41.370 Max. :100.00 Max. :10.000 Max. :365.0 ## NA&#39;s :10517 NA&#39;s :11564 NA&#39;s :11616 "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation The listings dataset is in csv format, which can be loaded into R directly. Although we import the data successfully, there are some transformations needed in order to perform further analysis. Subset the data. We reduced the dataset from 76 attributes to our selected 18 attributes. Missing values. We observe that there are no 0s in the bedrooms attribute. After exploring the listings description in the dataset and the Airbnb website, we notice that studios listing does not specify bedroom number. Therefore those listings with N/A bedrooms are all studios. In order to differentiate studio from other one-bedroom listings, we decided to use 0 bedrooms to denote those studios. listings$bedrooms[is.na(listings$bedrooms)] &lt;-0 Encode categorical variables. We encode the categorical variables neibourhood, neibourhood_group, room_type, and bedrooms as factors with corresponding levels.

As for missing values in bedrooms, we observe that there are no 0s in the bedrooms attribute. After exploring the listings description in the dataset and the Airbnb website, we notice that studios listing does not specify bedroom number. library(ggplot2) ggplot(listings, aes(as.factor(bedrooms))) + geom_bar(color = &quot;grey50&quot;, fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;,xlab=&quot;Number of bedrooms&quot;) "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results #numerical #histgram of price ggplot(data=dataset, aes(price))+ geom_histogram(fill=&#39;lightblue&#39;,color=&#39;grey&#39;)+ labs(x=&#39;price&#39;)+ ggtitle(&#39;Histogram of all price&#39;) ggplot(data=dataset, aes(price))+ geom_histogram(binwidth=10,fill=&#39;lightblue&#39;,color=&#39;grey&#39;)+ scale_x_continuous(name=&quot;price&quot;, limits=c(0, 1500))+ labs(x=&#39;price&#39;)+ ggtitle(&#39;Histogram of price from 0 to 1500&#39;) There exist a significant outlier in 10000, so we scale our x aixs from 0 to 1500.

And also, select bias effect the rating score, once people choose give the listing housing a review, they either extremely love or hate this house. #boxplot ggplot(dataset, aes(x = reorder(neighbourhood_group, -price, median), y = price)) + geom_boxplot(fill = &quot;green4&quot;,alpha=0.5)+ scale_y_continuous(name=&quot;price&quot;, limits=c(0, 500))+ labs(x=&#39;Neighbourhood Group&#39;)+ ggtitle(&#39;The Boxplot of Five Neighbourhood Group with ordered by price median&#39;) The box plot of five neighbourhood and rank by the median of prices shows Manhattan has the highest median price. And the Bron has the lowest median price. Even though the median price in five neighbourhoods are relative simliar. In addition, there is a hugh amount of outliers in the higher price. Even if there are a wider range outlier, the majority price still lower than $400. dataset$host_since &lt;- format(as.Date(dataset$host_since), format=&quot;%Y%m%d&quot;) dataset$host_since &lt;- as.Date(dataset$host_since, tryFormats = &quot;%Y%m%d&quot;) df2 &lt;- dataset %&gt;% filter(price&lt;800 &amp; host_since&lt;=&quot;2020-01-01&quot; &amp; host_since&gt;=&quot;2019-01-01&quot;) #group_by(host_since) ggplot(df2,aes(host_since,price))+ geom_point(color=&quot;pink1&quot;)+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;loess&quot;,span=0.4,color=&quot;orangered4&quot;)+ labs(x=&quot;Date&quot;,y=&quot;Price&quot;)+ ggtitle(&quot;NYC Airbnb price in Year 2019&quot;) df4 &lt;- dataset %&gt;% filter(price&lt;800 &amp; host_since&lt;&quot;2018-01-01&quot; &amp; host_since&gt;=&quot;2017-01-01&quot;) ggplot(df2,aes(host_since,price))+ geom_point(color=&quot;lightblue&quot;)+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;loess&quot;,span=0.4,color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;)+ labs(x=&quot;Date&quot;,y=&quot;Price&quot;)+ ggtitle(&quot;NYC Airbnb price in Year 2017&quot;) df3 &lt;- dataset %&gt;% filter(price&lt;800 &amp; host_since&lt;&quot;2021-01-01&quot; &amp; host_since&gt;=&quot;2020-01-01&quot;) ggplot(df3,aes(host_since,price))+ geom_point(color=&quot;tan1&quot;)+ geom_smooth(method=&quot;loess&quot;, span=0.4, color=&quot;tan4&quot;)+ labs(x=&quot;Date&quot;,y=&quot;Price&quot;)+ ggtitle(&quot;NYC Airbnb price in Year 2020&quot;) First, we adjust the price since we consider extreme price points as outliers. We filter the dataset when price is less than 800 dollars. Then we draw dot plots to see if there is any obvious pattern for date and price, which means we would like to explore if price is significantly associated with seasons. We separated by years since it is hard for us to see any patterns for the entire time period. Then we zoom in the data a little bit to see if there is any changes. The first and third plot is for year 2017 and 2019 separately, it is also hard to tell seasonal trend exists from both plots. And two plots look pretty similar. However, we can say that the frequencies of high prices are commonly seen in summer(may-Jun) and winter(Dec), which is kind of consistent with summer vacation and winter holiday. And the price is going to drop a little especially in Oct. Therefore, we could conclude price will be higher than usual especially in summer/winter holidays when people are more likely to travel during those time periods. Then we would like to know how the covid19 pandemic will affect Airbnb, so we draw another plot for year 2020. Based on the plot, we observe some differences between year 2020 and other years. First, we know the overall price is much lower than usual. Second, after April, the number of booking is jumped down so obviously, which is consistent with the situation of the pandemic. df_new &lt;- dataset %&gt;% na.omit() %&gt;% mutate(rating_rank=case_when(rating==100 ~ &quot;Perfect&quot;, rating&gt;=95 &amp; rating&lt;100 ~ &quot;Very Good&quot;, rating&gt;=90 &amp; rating&lt;95 ~ &quot;Good&quot;, rating&gt;=80 &amp; rating&lt;90 ~ &quot;Fair&quot;, rating&lt;80 ~ &quot;Bad&quot; )) c1 &lt;- c(&quot;skyblue3&quot;,&quot;lightblue&quot;,&quot;salmon&quot;,&quot;pink1&quot;) vcd::mosaic(room_type~neighbourhood_group, highlighting_fill=c1, df_new) c2 &lt;- c(&quot;skyblue3&quot;,&quot;salmon&quot;) vcd::mosaic(host_is_superhost~neighbourhood_group, highlighting_fill=c2, df_new) c3 &lt;- c(&quot;skyblue3&quot;,&quot;salmon&quot;) vcd::mosaic(host_is_superhost~rating_rank, highlighting_fill=c3, df_new) We applied mosaic plots to see frequencies for five areas based on room type and superhost, seperately. From the first plot, we can observe that entire home/apt and private room take the majority part of the room types in NYC Airbnb, which makes sense since few guests would like to share room/space with strangers. Also, it makes hosts lives much easier if they own the entire house/apt when they join the Airbnb, since they do not need to have aggrements with their roommates. The second plot shows that non-superhost is the majority among hosts in different areas in NYC. Also, we would like to find whether there is a positive relationship between superhost and rating, which implies superhost is more likely to get a better rating score for living experience. From the last plot, it is not obvious for us to confirm that hypothsis, however, we observe a bunch of guests have great living experience, regardless of superhost or not. The cleveland dot plot of five neighbourhoods, we could see the average rating score of Staten Island is the highest, while Brooklyn is the lowest rating score. Besides, the average rating score of all neighbourhood group are apporomately simliar the highst is 7 and lowest is 6. In Brooklyn, Bushwick has the lowest average rating score about 6, while Navy Yard, Fort Hamilton, and Brooklyn Heights, are the three neighbourhood touristor thought they are perfect with grade 10. Besides, most neighbourhoods in Brooklyn gets a score from 7 to 9. In Bronx, the score range are relatively wider, which means people may be polarization. West Farm has the lowest average rating score about 5.5, compare with Castle Hill has the highest rating score in 10 as perfect. The average rating score of all neighbourhood group in Bronx are from 8.3 to 9.5. In Manhattan, NoHo and Maple Hill has the highest rating score. And those central business district and shopping center like Midtown has the relatively lower rating score. And we can see the Upper town west where Columbia located also has the relatively low rating score. In addition, Harlem and East Harlem have the lowest score around 6.33. In Queens, Rego Park has the lowest score like 6.2, and about 6 neighbourhood has the highest rating score. In Staten Island, the range of score are narrower than others, which means people recommend most neighbourhood in Staten Island. Tompkinsville has the lowest rating score about 7.1. Other neighbouhood in Staten Island have a score higher than 8. And most of them are either 9.5 or 10. Staten Island might be most recommend living place for tourist. We use parallel coordinate plots to explore if any relationships exist among those numeric variables, such as number of bedrooms, price. Also,we draw those plots based on levels of selected categorical variables, such as rating_rank, room_type. The first plot is grouped by room_type. From the plot, we see entire home/apt and private room have a majority part among all types. We observe there is a negative relationship between number of bedrooms and price, which makes more sense if we consider room types here. It is obvious to see there is a positive relationship between price and rating. If price is high, the quality of the house is great, on average, thus guests will have good living experience. Whats more, there is a negative relationship between rating and reviews_per_month. The second plot is based on rating_rank. The shape of the plot is pretty similar with the one in the first plot. Negative relationships between number of bedrooms and price, rating and reviews_per_month. And a positive relationship between price and rating. From the alluvial plot, we clearly see that super-host is a small part among hosts in NYC Airbnb since a bunch of flows go through the FALSE node. For room types, entire home/apt and private room take the majority part among all types, which is consistent with travelers preference. Also, we observe that most Airbnb housing is located in Manhattan, which implies travelers will consider Manhattan first and it has a priority over other areas in NYC. In addition, guests have great living experience on average since most guests give the housing very good score. From the plot, we see a lot of flows pass through ranking nodes: Good, Very Good and Perfect. Also, super-hosts tend to have higher ratings since we barely see blue flows via Fair and Bad nodes. In general, Airbnb housing in NYC provides guests/travelers great living experiences. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Feel free to play around with our interactive map of NYC ! The interactive map of NYC is comprehensive and gives visitors a good sense of what Airbnbs offering in NYC. The map is friendly accessible: From the map, visitors can zoom in or out to select the region/neighborhood they would like to stay, then they can zoom in to see if any housing is available in that area. Next, they can click on the blue pinpoint and see some useful information, such as the room type, price per night and the rating for that housing. Those information we provided can help visitors better select their dream housing when they stay in NYC. Here we provide two pictures from the map to give you guys a better understanding of how the map works. From the first picture, we can see there is a bunch of red bubbles, and in each of them , there is a number. If we mouse on one bubble, you can see the related region/area represented by that bubble is plotted in blue lines. If we zoom in the map, you can see the second picture we provided here. Bubbles disappear but pinpoints show up. Each pinpoint represents one Airbnb housing available in the region selected. Clicking on it, you will see some basic information about that housing, such as price per night, rating, which is a more efficient way for visitors to make comparisons and choose the one that has a great cost performance. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Through this exploratory data analysis and visualization project, we gained insights into the Airbnb rental market. Below we will summarise the answers to the questions that we wished to answer at the beginning of the project: How is the price and rating of Airbnb in NYC? Excluding significant outliers, mean price is around 100. We find it interesting that most host would like to give a integer price with 0 in ones/ unit digit, and also 0 in tenth digit. How do prices vary by neighbourhoods? Manhattan has the highest median price. And the Bron has the lowest median price. What is the time series pattern for prices? There is no obvious seasonal pattern in past year prices. But we find frequencies of high prices are commonly seen in summer and winter, which is kind of consistent with summer vacation and winter holiday. What makes a host Super host? Guests have great living experience, regardless of superhost or not. How do rating scores vary by neighbourhoods? The average rating score of Staten Island is the highest, while Brooklyn is the lowest rating score. Is there any relations existing among variables? Negative relationshipS between number of bedrooms and price, rating and reviews_per_month; positive relationship between price and rating. Limitations Real data is not perfect especially for the missing values and large outliers. There were certain features such as acceptance_rate, monthly_price and description that either contained missing values or values in the free-text format that was not easy to work on and hence were dropped from our analysis. Also, we dont want to loose much information when we excluding outliers, but keeping thoses large numbers makes our plots not that standardized. Future Directions We want to deepen our analysis in 2020 and years after to see how our loved city experienced in this pandemic period and how is it has been recovered. We would also like to use our model in other cities to check their situations. "]]
